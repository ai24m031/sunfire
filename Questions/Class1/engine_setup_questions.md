# What is the difference between git and github?
* Git is a version control system for tracking changes in source code.
* GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories.
# Name 3 benefits of a version control system:
* Enables collaboration among developers.
* Tracks changes and history of code.
* Allows easy rollback to previous versions.
# Name 3 alternatives to git:
* Mercurial
* Subversion (SVN)
* Perforce
# Name 2 differences between git and other version control systems:
* Git is distributed, meaning each user has the full repository history locally, while others (like SVN) are centralized.
* Git's branching and merging are more flexible and lightweight compared to many alternatives.
# Name known issues related to game engines (Unreal, Unity) and version control systems:
* Large binary files (common in game assets) donâ€™t handle well in Git, leading to slow performance.
* Complex dependencies and large files make merging difficult and may require specialized tools (like Git LFS or Perforce).
